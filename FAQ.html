  <h2>How do you find my match?</h2>
  <h3>It's that simple.</h3>
  <p>When you buy a partner, we put you in a waiting list, where we wait for a secondary person that matches the
    description of your perfect partner. We then send you a message with the details of your match, and you can start
    chatting with them. The rest is history.</p>

  <h2>What if I dont like them?</h2>
  <h3>It's that simple too.</h3>
  <p>Firstly, we ask you to communicate to your partner about the issue. You can then contact us so we can unmatch you,
    and we'll start looking for a new match.</p>

  <h2>What if I can't find a match?</h2>
  <h3>Even simpler.</h3>
  <p>If you can't find a match and feel like this is not going to work out, we will issue a refund, where we will give
    you all of your money back in a 7 business days window, excluding the service fees.</p>
